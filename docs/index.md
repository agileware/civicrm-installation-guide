## Scope of this guide

This guide is for people installing a [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) instance for an organization. It will take you through downloading and installing CiviCRM on one of the supported Content Management Systems. It is not intended to provide information on installing the CMS itself.

### Installation Guide vs other guides

We also have a [User Guide](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest) which covers all the functionality available through CiviCRM's web-based interface and a [SysAdmin Guide](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest) which covers more advanced administration.

The two guides have some overlapping scope when it comes to setup and configuration. In general, we try to cover actions in the User Guide which the user can perform from within CiviCRM's user interface. Actions that require work outside of the CiviCRM interface (e.g. file-system or shell access) are covered in the System Administrator Guide.
